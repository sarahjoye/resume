            <ul>
                <li><i>Certified Advocacy Services Provider</i> - The Refuge Utah<br>
                Oct 2023 - Present<br>
                I respond to crisis calls for sexual assault by connecting survivors with resources and
                accompanying them to the hospital for after care and forensic examinations. I received 40+
                hours of training for this role.</li><br>
                <li><i>Sales Representative</i> - Ambia Solar<br>
                May 2023 - Aug 2023<br>
                In 3.5 months, I generated $400,000 revenue for my company by finding dozens of new leads. I
                knocked doors for 7-8 hours per day and built trust with customers who were skeptical and
                wholly unfamiliar with the product.</li><br>
                <li><i>Patient Care Technician</i> - Center for Change<br>
                Jan 2023 - Present<br>
                I provide consistent and compassionate care for patients with eating disorders. Along with my
                team, I manage groups of 20-30 patients, offering 24/7 care. I deescalate agitated patients, offer
                appropriate coping skills, create a peaceful and hopeful healing atmosphere, respond to crisis,
                validate patient feelings, chart patient progress, and firmly but kindly enforce center rules to
                help therapeutic programs run smoothly.</li><br>
                <li><i>Community Volunteer</i> - Utah County Children's Justice Center<br>
                Sep 2022 - Jan 2023<br>
                I welcomed children and their parents into the center in preparation for forensic examinations
                and legal interviews. I fostered and contributed to the center's safe and calming atmosphere.</li><br>
                <li><i>Full Time Volunteer</i> - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints<br>
                Feb 2021 - Jul 2022<br>
                I volunteered full-time in Texas, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, teaching one-on-one
                interventions to improve people's emotional, spiritual, and physical well-being, as well as their
                relationships. I generated hundreds of leads for involvement in our interventions, primarily
                refugees. I learned German and taught both German and English classes to many refugees and
                immigrants. Much of my time was spent connecting people with resources that could improve
                their situations.</li><br>
