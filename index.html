        <h3><span>About Me</span></h3>
        <h6><span>I am a business student pursuing a career in social entrepreneurship. I am interested in all the ways 
        that business, government, and nonprofit work can be combined to effectively address social 
        issues. I have 4 years of experience in the social work and nonprofit world. As a certified advocacy 
        services provider for victims of sexual assault, I have learned to keep a clear head in a crisis, 
        recognize and meet unspoken needs, and provide trauma-informed care. I currently work as a 
        behavioral technician in a residential care center for women with eating disorders. Here I have 
        developed strong leadership and interpersonal skills and increased my ability to provide 
        compassionate care. I have spent time teaching English to migrants in my community, volunteering 
        for a Children's Justice Center, and interacting with senior citizens. I also spent a year and half living 
        in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland as a volunteer for my church, where I became more familiar 
        with relevant European social issues, such as the refugee crisis, gender and racial equality, and 
        sustainable living practices. Read my research paper about German refugee integration <a href="https://1drv.ms/b/c/11a779dcc471b4ba/Ea3Dh1imLO1BmAUepSy5ARsB7C9i0wzyOgT_DjXHKzb5aA?e=bJbewB" target="_blank" title="Research Paper: German Refugee Integration">here</a>.
        <p>In addition to my experience in the nonprofit world, I've been involved in sales and spent a summer 
        selling solar panels door to door. There I gained negotiation skills, grit, and resilience. I am 
        interested in expanding my repertoire of hard business skills further and recently put time into 
        learning Tableau, VBA Excel, Flowcharts, HTML, CSS, and SQL (I made this page from scratch). I am studying Experience Design and Management in 
        the Brigham Young University school of business and am minoring in Global and Community 
        Impact. In this minor, we focus on measuring and evaluating impact, leveraging organizations to 
        build coalitions, and human-centered design. I hope my skills in these areas will be useful to your 
        organization.</p>
        <p>Areas of particular interest to me include refugee/migrant issues, children's issues, racial/ethnic
        equality, environmental issues, education, or any startup organization. My ultimate career goal is to 
        leverage my education and experience to make a positive, measurable impact on the lives of 
        individuals and communities in need. I look forward to learning from and working with you.</p></span></h6>
